# Project Summary

In this project, we'll complete the functionality of a social media platform by using `axios` in a `react` project. Majority of the application has already been built out for you. Take some time before starting to familarize yourself with the component structure. The platform we'll be building out is a scaled down version of twitter and we'll focus on the functionality for fetching all the DevMountain posts, creating new posts, editing existing posts, and deleting existing posts.

This is a live API, please be respectful and mindful of what you post.

* `Clone` your fork.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `npm install`.
* Run `npm start`.

## API Documentation

Before continuing to step 1, take a minute to browse the API documentation.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we'll import axios into the project and fetch all the DevMountain posts. Using the return posts array, we'll assign it to state and pass it down into the components that need it. Remember to use the API documentation to help you complete the steps.

### Instructions

* Run `npm install --save axios`.
* Open `./src/components/App.js`.
* Import `axios` at the top.
* Create a `componentDidMount` method that fetches all the posts using `axios`.
* Use the result of the `axios` call to set a `posts` array on state.
* Pass the posts array down as a `prop` called `posts` into the `Feed` component.
* Pass the posts array length down as a `prop` called `count` into the `Summary` component.

<summary> Detailed Instructions </summary>

<br />

Let's begin by importing `axios` into our project. In your command line, make sure you are in the root project directory, run `npm install --save axios`. Then open `./src/components/App.js` and at the top with the other imports, import axios.

```js
import axios from 'axios';
```

We are using this component to fetch the `posts` because it is the parent component to the `Summary` and `Feed` component. Both those components rely on the `posts` array. Let's create a `componentDidMount` method that uses `axios` to fetch our `posts`. Remember, when fetching data from a server always use a `GET` request. Using the API documentation we can see that the base API url is: `practiceapi.devmountain.com/api` and uses a `https` scheme. We can also see that all our post endpoints are under the `/posts` route.

```js
componentDidMount() {
  axios.get('https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts').then( results => {

  });
}
```

When inspecting the value of `results` we can see that the API puts the `posts` array on the `data` property. Let's assign that to `posts` on state.

```js
componentDidMount() {
  axios.get('https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts').then( results => {
    this.setState({ posts: results.data });
  });
}
```

To avoid any rendering errors before `posts` has a value on `state`, let's create a `constructor` method and default `posts` to be an empty array.

```js
constructor() {
  super();

  this.state = {
    posts: []
  }
}
```

Lastly, we'll just need to pass down the value of `posts` on state down into the children components that are depending on it. The `Summary` component depends on the length of `posts` to display it and the `Feed` component depends on `posts` to `map` over them and `render` them. Since I'll be referring to `this.state.posts` multiple times in my render method, I'll use `es6 destructuring` on `state`.

```js
render() {
  const { posts } = this.state;

  return (
    <div className="App__parent">
      <Header />

      <section className="App__content">
        <Summary count={ posts.length } />
        <Feed posts={ posts } />
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Solution

<summary> <code> ./src/components/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';


import './App.css';

import Header from './Header/Header';
import Summary from './Summary/Summary';
import Feed from './Feed/Feed';

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get('https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts').then( results => {
      this.setState({ posts: results.data });
    });
  }

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      posts: []
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { posts } = this.state;

    return (
      <div className="App__parent">
        <Header />

        <section className="App__content">
          <Summary count={ posts.length } />
          <Feed posts={ posts } />
        </section>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we'll use the `props` passed into the `Summary` and `Feed` component and render them onto the `DOM`.

### Instructions

* Open `./src/components/Summary/Summary.js`.
* Locate the `span` with the value of `###`.
* Replace `###` with the value of `count` off of props.
* Open `./src/components/Feed/Feed.js`.
* Map over the `posts` array off of props and render a `Post` component for each post.
  * Add a `text`, `id`, and `date` prop on each `Post` component and set them equal to values for each post.
  * Remember to use a `key` prop when mapping in React to avoid errors. The post ID will always be unique.

<summary> Detailed Instructions </summary>

<br />

Let's begin by opening `./src/components/Summary/Summary.js`. This is the component that sits on the left side of the posts feed ( `Feed` component ). It displays DevMountain's name, handle, and profile picture. Underneath those it is also displaying a post count which is currently equal to `###`. All we need to do is update that value to use the value we are passing down through props. 

```js
<span className="Summary__posts-value">{ this.props.count }</span>
```

We're done with that component now. Let's move on to the `Feed` component. This component sits on the right side of the `Summary` component. It displays a feed of `posts`. Let's map over the `posts` array that we are passing down through props and render a `Post` component for each `post`. The `Post` component is a child component for the `Feed` component that handles displaying posts and also offering a way to edit and delete a `post`. When mapping, we need to pass props down into the `Post` component in order for the `Post` component to display the data. We'll need a `text`, `date`, `id`, and `key` prop.

```js
{
  this.props.posts.map( post => (
    <Post key={ post.id }
          text={ post.text }
          date={ post.date }
          id={ post.id } />
  ))
}
```

Now the `Post` component will be able to reference each individual post's data by using `this.props.text`, `this.props.date`, and `this.props.id`.
